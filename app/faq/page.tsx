                  <p className="text-editorial text-gray-700">
                    West Rose Media provides high-end photography, video, and done-for-you content execution for established entrepreneurs and business owners. The focus is on authority, trust, and inbound demand rather than trends or volume posting.

                  <p className="text-editorial text-gray-700">
                    The ICON Brand Partnership is designed for founders who already have a business and need a strong online presence that reflects their level. Strategy, production, and execution are handled end to end.

                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-3">How is this different from hiring a photographer or social media manager?</h3>
                  <p className="text-editorial text-gray-700">
                    West Rose Media combines strategy, photography, video, and publishing into a single system. Clients are not coordinating freelancers or managing content logistics.

                  <p className="text-editorial text-gray-700">
